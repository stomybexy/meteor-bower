# Meteor-Bower

Include bower dependencies in your meteor package. 

## Usage
Add a bower.json file in your package and api.use this package. That's all.
Bower dependencies are installed in /public/bower_components by default. To change that, 
just add a /public/.bowerrc file in your meteor project.
